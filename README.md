# BarLights

This is a project that runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses a Hall effect sensor to turn my friend's dark (and expertly stocked) liquor cabinet into a beautifully lit LED extravaganza, just by opening the cupboard door.

Uses [Fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) and [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/software/touchosc).

To run on Raspberry Pi:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

To run locally for development (uses a simulator to render LEDs):

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
