# barlights

This is a project that runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses a Hall effect sensor to turn my friend's dark liquor cabinet into a beautifully lit LED extravaganza, just by opening the cupboard door.

Uses [Fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy).

To run:

- `server/fcserver-rpi`
- `cd app`
- `npm install`
- `node main.js`
